var can be accessed outside the block in which it was declared.
let can only be accessed in the block.

while condition only

anonymous fuctions can be created by saving the function def to a var
    var add = function(x,y){
        return x+y;
    }

    or 

    var add = (x+y)=>{
        return x+y;
    }


    function add(x,y)=>{x+y};

    type is fuction
    
    
    dictionary
        var person={
            fullName: "aadi",
            age: 22,
            email: "aadi@mail"
        }
         
         person.age = 23
         person.planet = "earth"

    array 
        var data = ["my name",25]

        array is a fixed size collection

        var is stored on either depending on type
        heap memory - 
        stack memory -

        static languages rewrite the value at memory
        dynamic assigns new memory for each
